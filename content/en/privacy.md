# Processing of personal data

This website does not use Cookies or any form of data
processing. Its sole purpose is the publication of content.

## Retrieval of web pages

When accessing these web pages, the visitor's browser automatically transmits
data about the desired resource, the IP address to which the data needs to be
transmitted, as well as specific data from previous requests (cookies,
referrers, forms, etc.).

Parts of this data is automatically logged to ensure technical operation. This
data is basically only used for manual post-mortem analysis, otherwise
automatically deleted after seven days.

## Cookies

Users do not receive any cookies from the web server.

## Embedding external content

This webpage loads the 'jquery' library from 'https://code.jquery.com' and the
'lunr' library for local search functionality from 'https://unpkg.com'.
All other content is delivered directly from the server.
An embedding of external content occurs automatically when the content cannot
be provided technically locally. This generally applies to the
browser-dependent provision of CSS / font data for a consistent
presentation of the web content. Typically, this data is cached by the browser
and fetched only once. A correlation between the individual website visits and
the reloading of these resources is therefore not mandatory.

In all these cases, the browser of the visitor himself sends corresponding data
to the respective external server.

##  Supervisory authority

In case of complaints, please contact the [Bavarian Data Protection Commissioner](https://www.datenschutz-bayern.de/service/complaint.html).
