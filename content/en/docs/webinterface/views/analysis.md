The analysis view is always called in respect to one specified cluster. It collects and renders data based on the jobs returned by the active filter, which can be specified to a high detail, allowing analysis of specific aspects.

{{< alert >}}*Please note:* By default, the requested data is limited by a preset start time filter to jobs started within *the last 6 hours*. In addition, some results are not calculated when the returned amount of jobs exceeds 500 entries, in order to save on rendering time.{{< /alert >}}

### General Information

The general information section of the analysis view is always rendered and consists of the following elements

#### Totals

Total counts of collected data based on the returned jobs matching the requested filters:

* Total Jobs
* Total Short Jobs (By default defined as jobs shorter than 5 minutes)
* Total Walltime
* Total Node Hours
* Total Core Hours
* Total Accelerator Hours

#### Top Users and Projects

The ten most active users or projects are rendered in a combination of pie chart and tabular legend. By default, the top ten users with the most jobs conforming to the selected filters will be shown.

The selection can be changed directly in the headers of the pie chart and the table, and can be changed to

|Element|Options|
|-------|-------|
|Pie Chart|`Users, Projcets`|
|Table|`Wall Time, Node Hours, Core Hours, Accelerator Hours`|

The selection is saved for each user and cluster, and will select the last chosen types of list as default the next time this view is rendered.

"User Names" and "Project Codes" are rendered as links, leading to [user job lists]({{< ref "userjobs" >}} "User Job List") or [project job lists]({{< ref "joblist" >}} "Project Jobs") with preset filters for cluster and entity ID.

#### Heatmap Roofline

A [roofline plot]({{< ref "plots#heatmap-roofline" >}} "Roofline Plot") representing the utilization of available resources as the relation between computation and memory for all jobs matching the filters. In order to represent the data in a meaningful way, the time information of the raw data is abstracted and represented as a heat map, with redder sections of the roofline plot being the most populated regions of utilization.

#### Histograms

Two histograms depicting the duration and number of allocated cores distributions for the returned jobs matching the filters.

### Selectable Data Representations

{{< figure src="../../figures/analysis_selections.png" alt="Analysis View Plot Selection" width="100%" class="ccfigure mw-xxs">}}

The second half of the analysis view consists of areas reserved for rendering user-selected data representations.

* *Select Plots for Historgrams:* Opens a selector listing all configured metrics of the respective cluster. One or more metrics can be selected, and the data returned will be rendered as average distributions normalized by node hours.
* *Select Plots in Scatter Plots*: Opens a selector which allows selection of user chosen combinations of configured metrics for the respective cluster. Selected duplets will be rendered as scatter bubble plots for each selected pair of metrics.

    caption="Three pairs of metrics are already selected for scatter representation. Remove a selected pair by pressing the 'x' button, add a new pair by selecting two metreic from the dropdown menu, and confirming by 'Add Plot'."

#### Average Distribution Histograms

{{< figure src="../../figures/analysis_average_dists.png" alt="Analysis View Average Distributions" width="100%" class="ccfigure mw-lg"
    caption="Three selected metrics are represented as normalized, average distributions based on returned jobs"
>}}

These histograms show the distribution of the normalized averages of all jobs matching the filters, split into 50 bins for high detail.

Normalization is achieved by weighting the selected metric data job averages by node hours (default), or by either accelerator hours (for native accelerator scope metrics) or core hours (for native core scope metrics).

{{< alert >}}*Please note:* Metrics, which are disabled for specific subclusters as per metric configuration file, will be returned as null values if data is requested for the whole cluster, which can affect the rendered distributions. Select a specific partition using the cluster filter to evade this artifact.{{< /alert >}}

#### User Defined Scatterplots

{{< figure src="../../figures/analysis_scatters.png" alt="Analysis View Scatter Plots" width="100%" class="ccfigure mw-lg"
    caption="Three user defined scatter plots"
>}}

Bubble scatter plots show the position of the averages of two selected metrics in relation to each other.

Each circle represents one job, while the size of a circle is proportional to its node hours. Darker circles mean multiple jobs have the same averages for the respective metric sleection.
