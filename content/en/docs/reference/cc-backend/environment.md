All security-related configurations, e.g. keys and passwords, are set using environment variables. It is supported to set these by means of a `.env` file in the project root.

## Environment Variables

An example env file is found in [this directory](https://github.com/ClusterCockpit/cc-backend/tree/master/configs "env-template.txt"). Copy it as `.env` into the project root and adapt it for your needs.

* `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` and `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`: Base64 encoded Ed25519 keys used for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. You can generate your own keypair using `go run ./cmd/gen-keypair/gen-keypair.go`. For more information, see the [JWT documentation]({{< ref "jwtoken" >}} "JSON Web Token").
* `SESSION_KEY`: Some random bytes used as secret for cookie-based sessions.
* `LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The LDAP admin user password (optional).
* `CROSS_LOGIN_JWT_HS512_KEY`: Used for token based logins via another authentication service.
* `LOGLEVEL`: Can be `crit`, `err`, `warn`, `info` or `debug`. Can be used to reduce logging. Default is `info`.
